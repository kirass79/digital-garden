If you want to blog with Obsidian, then this article will show you how.

**There are two ways to start blogging with Obsidian: Using Obsidian Publish (Paid) or using the Obsidian WordPress Publish community plugin (Free)**

This article will show you how to set up both methods and the one you should choose.

Let‚Äôs get started.

## Benefits of Blogging with Obsidian

Obsidian is not only a note-taking tool but also a great writing app. Why would anyone consider blogging with Obsidian?

Here are the main reasons:

### Plain text files

Obsidian rises above all the other note-taking tools because it stores your notes in plain text (markdown) files. This means you‚Äôll always have a backup of your blogs on your local drive or cloud storage (depending on where you‚Äôre storing your vault.)

### Works everywhere

Obsidian is a free app that works natively on every platform: Mac, iOS, Android, Windows, Linux‚Ä¶ You name it.

This is especially helpful if you work on many different devices and across different operating systems.

This allows you to work on your blogs without any platform limitations.

### Frictionless

Your blog is an excellent way to share your thoughts and expertise online.

And blogging with Obsidian makes total sense since it contains all your notes.

No more back and forth between different apps and interfaces. You can enjoy a streamlined content creation workflow within Obsidian.

**This makes note-taking, thinking, linking, creating, and sharing as easy as pie.**

## Obsidian Publish

The first option to start blogging with Obsidian is using Obsidian‚Äôs native service called Obsidian publish.

This feature allows you to publish your blog in an obsidian style kind of blog like so:

### How to set up Obsidian Publish

#### Creating and logging into your Obsidian account

The first thing is to create an Obsidian account (if you don‚Äôt have one already)

Second, you‚Äôll need to log into your account in Obsidian.

For that, simply open **Obsidian** > **Settings** > **About** > **Account** > **Log in**

![Obsidian login](https://mattgiaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/obsidian-publish-login-1024x707.png)

Now, subscribe to Obsidian Publish on [Obsidian‚Äôs official website](https://obsidian.md/publish).

By the time of writing this article, it costs $20 per month (or $192 per year) per site:

![Obsidian Publish Pricing for blog](https://mattgiaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/obsidian-publish-blogging-pricing-1024x592.png)

### Activate the Obsidian Publish Plugin

For that, simply head over **Settings** > **Core plugins** > **Publish**

![how to activate Obsidian Publish plugin](https://mattgiaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/obsidian-publish-activate-plugin-1024x501.png)

Once activated, you‚Äôll notice a new icon on the left-hand sidebar that looks like this:

![Obsidian Publish Icon Left-Hand menu](https://mattgiaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/obsidian-publish-icon.png)

**Click** on it.

Now you can activate your site

**Under Site ID**, enter the path you want for your site. For example, my one would be: Matt Giaro publish.obsidian.md/mattgiaro

Then, click **Create**.

Now, you want to specify which notes should be published and which don‚Äôt.

You do so by heading over to the Publish changes dialog.

Click NEW to see all the notes you haven‚Äôt published yet.

-   Select the notes you want to publish.
-   Click Publish.

And voila.

There are more things to do with Obsidian publish, such as specifying your own [domain name](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Set+up+a+custom+domain).

### Issues when blogging with Obsidian Publish

Obsidian Publish is easy to set up.

But I would not recommend using it. There are multiple reasons for that.

Here are the most important ones:

#### Pricing

I feel that the pricing is just not worth it. You could get more bang for your buck by buying hosting and installing as many WordPress installations as you need to handle your blog.

#### Lack of customization

Obsidian Publish looks cool.

But you can‚Äôt really build a website that captures leads. Plus, if people are already familiar with the concept of linked notes, having a graph view on the right may make sense. It will confuse the 99% remaining once.

#### Obisidian Publish is not optimized for SEO

The second major flaw is that Obsidian is not optimized for SEO.

But one of the reasons you‚Äôre creating content is to get discovered online, right?

When you know that Search Traffic is one of the best free and long-lasting traffic sources out there, using Obsidian Publish to share your work is shooting yourself in the foot.

The reason is that it has a [improper linking format](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/xib3m0/obsidian_publish_has_a_technical_seo_issue/) in the sidebar, are does not allows you to [customize meta data](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/custom-meta-tags-value-for-seo-improvements-in-publish/12115) for images, or the pages themselves.

So if you want to set up your blog with Obsidian, I recommend the second option below.

## obsidian to blog with the Obsidian WordPress Publish Plugin

Obsidian shines because it has a very strong and passionate community around it.

This means that you‚Äôll find a lot of free plugins created by amazing developers to make your life in Obsidian easier.

When it comes to blogging, there‚Äôs a great plugin created by [devbean](https://devbean.github.io/obsidian-wordpress/).

**What this plugin allows you to do is to directly publish an article from Obsidian to your WordPress blog.**

Why WordPress? WordPress powers every fourth website on the internet. It‚Äôs a blogging solution that has demonstrated its robustness and versatility.

You can‚Äôt go wrong with WordPress.

### Installing Obsidian WordPress Publish

First, you need to install the Obsidian plugin.

1.  Open your Obsidian vault
2.  Click on Settings (gear on the bottom left)
3.  Go to Community plugins (In case it‚Äôs your first community plugin, you need to deactivate the safe mode first)
4.  Click on Browse

#### Create a WordPress application password

For this plugin to work, you need to give the plugin access to your website.

1.  Simply head over to your admin panel at: https://yoursite.com/admin
2.  Log in.
3.  And then click on **Users > Profile**

![Create user for obsidian wordpress publish](https://mattgiaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/obsidian-publish-create-user.png)

And if you want Obsidian to remember the credentials, toggle on the ‚ÄúRemember Username‚Äù and ‚ÄúRemember Password‚Äù options.

7.  A new window will appear asking you for 3 things:

![Blog settings for Obsidian WordPress publish](https://mattgiaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/obsidian-wordpress-blog-settings-1024x752.png)

-   First, the status: Would like your post to go live or keep it as a draft?
-   Second, the comments: Do you want comments turned on or off?
-   Third, the post category.

Select the options that suit you and hit enter.

## Blogging With Obsidian: Conclusion

If you want **to blog with Obsidian** you have two choices.

While both Obsidian Publish and the Obsidian WordPress plugin are pretty easy to set up, I‚Äôd recommend the latter.

The reason is that WordPress is still one of the best platforms to start your blog. It allows you to rank on Google (SEO optimized), and you can also use it to create your sales pages, add capture forms, etc.

More important than how to set up your blog with Obsidian is to have a rock-solid workflow to turn your notes into online content.
