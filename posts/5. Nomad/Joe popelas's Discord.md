-  **How do I start?** Start by making your product. You'll get better and more efficient at it over time. Go to ⁠tools and click the “ChatGPT”, Ask ChatGPT to write you a book outline on [topic] with 8 – 13 chapters. Chapters are counted with integers. Topics are bullet points under Chapter topics. Each chapter has 3 topics. Then refine the output. Boom! You started a book. 
- **What niche should I make my e-book in?** Good ones are Business, Fitness and Relationships. 
- **Website?** Whop.com **Benefits of Whop?** No monthly fee. Only takes 3% of your profit. 
- **Which version of GPT?** Make sure you use GPT-3 playground and not ChatGPT for long form. I use GPT-3's API and pay for their enterprise subscription. 
- **What is the difference between these versions?** ChatGPT is a smaller version of GPT-3. It is trained on a similar dataset and uses the same architecture, but has fewer parameters and therefore requires less computational power to run. GPT-3 (which you can access on GPT-3 Playground) is currently the largest and most powerful language model developed by OpenAI, while ChatGPT is one of the smaller models in the GPT family. Both have their own use cases. 
- **Do you put your name as the author?** I put my brand name. It used to be “Boundless”, but I had to change it because it was trademarked. 
- **How are you going through with proofreading? A third-party service that you are turning in raw chat3 text into?** I create an eBook (25K - 50K words). I pay my ghostwriter to proofread and add value. Don’t recommend paying for a ghostwriter or proofreader at the start. 
- **Is there a particular reason on why it picked up around that time (Q4 2022) and did you notice you were doing something wrong or improved on something that helped you gain sales?**

    - I started writing eBooks catered to middle-aged women wanting to start up their own business. I also figured my ads out. 
    - **How many e-Books’ do you have running at the same time?** I have 5 e-book bundles right now with their own landing pages each.
    - **How many chapters in a book?** It depends on the book but over 8 under 15 is a good range to shoot for. 
    - **About how many tokens per e-book?** Just checked, around 130,000 tokens, so about 3 dollars a book. 
    - **With this business model will I have to have a personal brand?** No, you will need a book brand. 
    - **After the AI writes, what do you use to put together the e-book itself?** Microsoft word. Sometimes my ghostwriter formats it for me. 
    - **How long does it usually take you to put to together one of the books manually?** On a good day, probably about 3 hours in total. You’ll probably be super slow at the start like I was. 
    - **What do you use your ghostwriter for?** Making sure the book makes sense and sometimes to add value to it. I have one on retainer right now for about $2200 a month.
    - **Does the ad direct to a landing page for the book?** Yes, and landing page buttons redirect to respective products’ whop checkout. **So start-up cost?** $500 will 100% get you far. You can go with lower but you risk going negative if a product/ad doesn't perform well at the start. You need money to learn with. Trial and error. **Should I learn python for this?**

    - No, just use GPT-3 playground. **As one university student to another, is it worth getting into this if I don’t have healthy capital?** NO. **What was your old brand called?** My old book brand was called "Boundless". **Do you upload them in PDF format?** Yes, PDFs. I uploaded one time in ePUB and I got a bunch of, “Help. I can’t open the book”. **Did you have to get any licenses/permits?** No. I have a GPT-3 license but other than that no. You get the licence by just paying for your usage. **What GPT-3 model do you use? How much does a book cost in tokens.** It's about 130,000 tokens for the average book. I use Davinci-003. $0.02 per 1K tokens. **Are you just changing up the wording on other eBooks or making them completely from scratch?** Scratch. **What do you use to proofread for plagiarism?** A human - I pay someone to do it. You can use QuillBot though. Much cheaper. Go to ⁠tools for the link. **Do you usually complete most of the book all in one single prompt or do you break it down into different header sections per prompt?** You 100% need to break it down. GPT by design is not made for long-form. **Where are these books sold on?** Landing page on Typedream with CTA buttons that link to respective whop product checkout. **What marketing strategy do you use on your landing page?**

 - ALWAYS talk about what the book will do for the buyer. Pull on their emotions. **Do you create the graphics/pictures for the Pinterest ads yourself?** Yes, I use photoshop. You can pay someone on Fiverr though. **What is the landing page for? And how does it correlate with whop?** The landing page is to sell the warm lead on your product. One paragraph on whop won’t cut it. **How much did you put into ads before they paid for themselves?** I sunk $2000 into it before I broke even but that’s because I didn’t know what I was doing. Also spent 1K on GPT-3 when I was making my python script. Some other losses too. **Do you use a lot of images inside your books?** No, I use none. **Did you make most of your profit in Q4? Are the big financial gains once you establish the brand and get social proof?** Yes and 100%. Financial gains came for me when I started selling in a specific niche and paid close attention to my analytics. **Do you create a brand name for each book niche?** Everything is under the same brand. Creating different brands might help though. Haven’t tried it. **Do you use paid Typedream or just the free version?** Paid (yearly). **How much do you usually charge for each ebook?** I sell bundles with 5 Books inside. It’s $4.95. I do NOT suggest starting at $4.95. You will struggle to stay profitable. Price your products from $10 - $15 to start. I also have my email list. **The bundles of 5 are all matching topics I assume?** Yes. Similar topics. **So, Pinterest ads take people to whop, where you sell them the book?** No, Pinterest directs to my landing page on Typedream and then Typedream links to my Whop product checkout. **When did you create/start this business model?** I came up with this business's model back in July of 2022. I got the idea after I consulted with a publishing company. As far as I know. I am currently the largest AI eBook brand on the market. **Do you recommend Amazon KDP?** No, Amazon scans books for AI generated content.
